The term stout was initially used to indicate a stronger porter than other porters issued by an individual brewery. Though not consistent, this is the usage that was most commonly employed. More recently, 'stout' tends to be used to describe dry stouts, (containing a small amount of unmalted roast barley), or sweet stouts, (such as milk stouts), whilst 'porter' describes a beer flavoured with roast malted barley.;T:metadata{	:dependencieso:Set:
