This process makes the beer appear bright and clean, rather than the cloudy appearance of ethnic and older styles of beer such as wheat beers. Examples of clarifying agents include isinglass (obtained from the swimbladders of fish), various seaweed extracts, polycar (artificial additive), and gelatin.;T:metadata{	:dependencieso:Set:
