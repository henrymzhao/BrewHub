The flower of the hop vine is used as a flavouring and preservative agent in nearly all beer made today. The flowers themselves are often called 'hops'. <br><br>Hops contain several characteristics that brewers desire in beer. Hops contribute a bitterness that balances the sweetness of the malt; the bitterness of beers is measured on the International Bitterness Units scale. Hops contribute floral, citrus, and herbal aromas and flavours to beer. Hops have an antibiotic effect that favours the activity of brewer's yeast over less desirable microorganisms and aids in 'head retention', the length of time that a foamy head created by carbonation will last. The acidity of hops is a preservative.;T:metadata{	:dependencieso:Set:
